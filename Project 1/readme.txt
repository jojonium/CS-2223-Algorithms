To run:
1. Run 'project1.py'
2. Enter a positive integer at the first prompt
3. Enter a positive integer at the second prompt

The GCD of the two integers will be calculated by three different algorithms, and the program will print
the results from each algorithm as well as the amount of time each algorithm took.
