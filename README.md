# CS-2223-Algorithms
Coursework and projects for CS 2223: Algorithms

Project 1 looks at the time efficiencies of different methods for computing the GCD of two integers.
Project 2 examines the difference in time efficiency between solving the Closest Pair problem with a recursive algorithm vs a brute force algorithm.
Project 3 examines the difference in time efficiency between solving the Knapsack Problem with a dynamic programming method, an exhaustive search, and a greedy algorithm.
